            <h3>My Career</h3>
            <p class="career">In order to become a doctor you need a bachelors degrees (any degree would work, but its better to have one relating to medicine/biology)
               You also will need to pass the medical collage admission exam. After passing the exam you will then spend spend 4 years in medical school and then spend at least 3 years working as a medical resident in a hospital under a licensed doctor. 
               All this education is worth it though, as the average salary of a doctor is $181,201 which is a lot of money. Instead of doing the same thing every day like in a office job I could instead help people and do something more interesting then sit all day, while making a good amount of money. 
               For this job you would need advanced medical knowledge as well as some knowledge on specific procedure/medical areas like surgery and eye care.
